# One AI Model for Multi-scenario Reconstructions: Physics-informed Synthetic Data Boosts Generalizable Deep Learning for Fast MRI
This work presents a Physics-Informed Synthetic data learning framework for Fast MRI, called PISF, which is the first to enable generalizable DL for multi-scenario MRI reconstruction using solely one trained model.

1) We demonstrate that training DL models on synthetic data, integrated with enhanced learning techniques, can achieve comparable or even better *in vivo* MRI reconstruction compared to models trained on a matched realistic dataset—PISF reduces the demand for real-world MRI data by up to 96%. 
2) Our PISF shows impressive generalizability in multi-vendor multi-center imaging—it can reconstruct high-quality images of 4 anatomies and 5 contrasts across 5 vendors and centers using a single trained network.
3) PISF’s superior adaptability to patients has been verified through 10 experienced doctors’ evaluations (4 neuro radiologists and 1 neurosurgeon for brain tumor patients, and 3 cardiac radiologists and 2 cardiologists for myocardial hypertrophy patients)—its overall image quality steps into the excellent level in reader study.

In summary, PISF provides a feasible and cost-effective way to markedly boost the widespread usage of DL in various fast MRI applications, while freeing from the intractable ethical and practical considerations of *in vivo* human data acquisitions.
